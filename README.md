# ðŸ§  AIRoadShow: Copilot Studio + Azure AI Workshop & Mini Hack

Welcome! This repository contains all the resources you need to **run, host, or participate** in the Copilot Studio + Azure AI enablement workshop and mini hackathon.

This hands-on learning experience guides you through building an intelligent Copilot agent called **Sales Buddy** using Microsoft technologies like **Copilot Studio**, **Azure AI Search**, **Azure OpenAI**, and more.

1. **Review the [Lab Setup Guide](https://github.com/sshashi7/AIRoadShow/blob/main/Lab%20Setup%20Guide.pdf)**  
   Sign up for Copilot Studio trial/sandbox and Azure subscription, and configure environments before starting the labs.

2. **Begin with the Labs**  
   Go to [Lab Guides](https://github.com/sshashi7/AIRoadShow/tree/main/Lab%20Guides) and follow each guide in order.  
   You'll progressively build an intelligent **Sales Buddy Agent** capable of:
   - Using Reasoning and Orchestration
   - Querying data (Dataverse, documents, and website)
   - Performing actions like registering leads and events
   - Analyzing documents and call transcripts
   - Integrating with Teams
   - Leveraging OpenAI and Azure AI Search 
  
   **Note**: Some labs require files/assets which is accessible under [Lab Assests](./lab-assets/). Download the zip file to your computer and have these files ready for executing the labs successfully. 

4. **Take on the Hackathon Challenge**  
   When you're done with the labs, head to the [hackathon folder](./hackathon/) and try your hand at building an **autonomous agent** using advanced orchestration and triggers.

5. **ðŸ“‘ Reference the Presentation Decks**  
   Use the [Presentation](./event%20deck/) for instructor-led presentation slides or self-paced context.
